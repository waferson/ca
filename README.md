## Software Installation

We will use R and Rstudio. In some sessions, we will use additional packages for R.

### Steps

**Install R**

  - Download R from: https://www.r-project.org (in our case version 3.6.3): [Windows](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/), [Mac](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
  - Choose any mirror for downloading (for example [cloud.r](https://cloud.r-project.org))
  - Install and follow the instructions
  - [Mac] Download clang 7 and gfortran 6.1 as well from [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/)

**Install Rstudio**

We recommend Rstudio, an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) with lots of features that makes R easier to use:

  - Download Rstudio Desktop from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download (in our case version 1.2.5042)

**Optional**

If you want to knit PDF files, it is recommended to install MikTex or MacTex, distributions for LaTex.

  - [Mac] You can download the distribution for Windows from [https://miktex.org/](https://miktex.org/).
  - [Windows] You can download the distribution for Mac from [https://www.tug.org/mactex/](https://www.tug.org/mactex/).
  - In case you don't need all the features of a complete Tex instalation, you can install only the [TinyTex package](https://yihui.name/tinytex/).

In case you need a multipurpose text editor, I recommend [Atom](https://atom.io).
